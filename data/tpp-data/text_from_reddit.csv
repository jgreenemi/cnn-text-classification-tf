many of us had been waiting for this moment for a long time. dozens of /r/spacex fans descended on the city of guadalajara in mexico for a chance to watch,Reddit comment
the brightest and most inspiring hour of the year. as fans we were attending the same events as the heads of the industry; we had no claim to the best,Reddit comment
seats in the house or to any kind of vip treatment. but multiple spacex employees took it on themselves to better our experience this week for no personal gain of,Reddit comment
their own. this kind of selflessness was pretty damn inspiring and we’d be amiss if we didn’t at least acknowledge their professionalism and generosity. many of us queued early enough,Reddit comment
to be confused with kanye west fans buying the latest pair of yeezy’s - 4am wake ups with queues over 8 hours before the event attempting to speak in barely,Reddit comment
comprehendable spanish to ensure we could queue and sit where we wanted to. this paid off initially! we managed to secure the best seats in the entire theatre - quite,Reddit comment
literally front row seats for the upcoming talk. the day began with a round-table talk on “how space agencies will contribute to the implementation and follow-up of the paris agreement,Reddit comment
during cop 21” including key figures from all of the large space agencies around the world. nasa esa csa jaxa roscosmos dlr isro and of course the mexican space agency.,Reddit comment
before the talk we had the pleasure to meet the cordial and witty jan wörner the director general for esa who spoke amicably with all of us telling us why,Reddit comment
he’d get us to mars before spacex (with a quick stop on the moon). he then took a moment out of his presentation to tell the entire iac how pleased,Reddit comment
he was that so many young fans had camped overnight to view his speech on climate change. great guy. of course it can never be perfectly perfect :). we were,Reddit comment
informed that the rows we were sitting in were reserved for vips you know… those pesky heads of state moon-walkers government officials celebrities and event organizers. we were meant to,Reddit comment
be seated about ten rows back in amongst the far larger general attendance two to three times more distant from the stage. fear not young fans! emily shanklin & dex,Reddit comment
torricke-barton of spacex approached and spoke with us were incredibly understanding of the dilemma (and sympathetic to the cause) and managed to negotiate with iac officials exceptionally well placed seats,Reddit comment
grouped in amongst the vips; in the first second third and fourth rows. this is above and beyond anything we could ever have considered possible. no one asked them to,Reddit comment
do this there was no requirement for them to do so. but they did it anyway. can you name one other large company that treats their fans in such a,Reddit comment
generous fashion? we were allowed to queue in the vip access line at the side of the venue treated to free post-it notes to indicate our unique affiliation and allowed,Reddit comment
to enter into the vip section in front of press and the rest of the attendees. we did our best keep our line tidy and organized. for comparison here’s r/spacex,Reddit comment
queuing… and here’s the rest of the vip officials. the talk was great. we were in shock for sure. we sadly had no chance of asking questions - being seated,Reddit comment
in the vip section meant we were roped off from the general crowd; and the microphones were positioned behind us at the front of the general attendees which meant we,Reddit comment
had to get out of our seats and move back not forwards. out of the 3000 people in attendance maybe 1000 tried to ask a question. tvd ran to the,Reddit comment
queue but there was very little chance for him (however he did meet some interesting people while queueing). there may be a reprieve coming soon though which hopefully we can,Reddit comment
discuss at a future date. there’s so many great people here. of course we have to extend a big shoutout to robert clark (/u/forthemission ) who made subreddit lanyards to,Reddit comment
replace the stock lockheed martin (awkward!) ones we were given. here’s two messages from some of the attendees we’ve had the pleasure of hanging out with over the past few,Reddit comment
days: in regards to the vip seating they were able to negotiate for us thank you for recognizing that we are more than a simple web community and that many,Reddit comment
of us are talented individuals with the skills to actively contribute. they really showed they value us today. - robert clark (/u/forthemission ) being able to attend elon's talk at,Reddit comment
iac 2016 in itself was an amazing experience. but the accommodation and enthusiasm that the spacex team showed the individuals from r/spacex who attended the talk went above and beyond.,Reddit comment

mains and desserts for the 30 people who attended. great bunch of people. thank you to the wider subreddit and other generous citizens who donated to the iac crowdfunding campaign,Reddit comment
for us. it would not have been possible without you. we’re still midway through the conference so we haven’t had time to fully organize our photos and media just yet,Reddit comment

the better way to answer this question is to offer a few snapshots of how everyday future life on mars could conceivably look like in a couple of decades as,Reddit comment
experienced by an average adult from earth only using existing technologies and the vast resources of mars: winged flight: on mars you will be able to fly up 300 feet,Reddit comment
(100m) into the air using your own muscle power only with carbon fiber wings within large self-pressurized domes that are trapping the heat of the sun and are hosting jungles,Reddit comment
with trees that grow ~2 times higher than on earth. extreme cliff diving: on mars you will be able to do safe cliff diving jumps from 160 feet (50m) tall,Reddit comment
trees into crystal clear water. mars has plenty of water: if all the surface water was molten then it would create a whole-planet ocean more than 300 feet (100m) deep.,Reddit comment
(!) waterfalls: and the martian waterfalls! in low martian gravity they are falling down in a gracious arc (almost) defying gravity. you can watch them all day and not get,Reddit comment
bored. running: on mars you will be able to run at a speed of 30 mph (50 kmh) faster than ushain bolt without breaking a sweat. (but stopping is not,Reddit comment
"so easy admittedly.) jumping: on mars you will be able to do a standing jump to higher than 80"" (200 cm) - higher than the current standing jump world record",Reddit comment
"of 60"" (150 cm). diving: on mars you will be able to go scuba diving into (warm) water filled underground lava tubes and dive 330 feet (100m) deep with regular",Reddit comment
scuba equipment without special deep diving equipment and without lengthy (and dangerous) decompression cycles. tropical rain: in the martian jungle you'll experience rain like you've never experienced it on earth:,Reddit comment
round thick raindrops falling down as if in slow motion. a mesmerizing sight - and very relaxing! sleeping: on mars you will also have the sleep of your lifetime: in,Reddit comment
37% gravity the lungs move easier and are less compressed and your own weight restricts blood flow in limbs a lot less. also in the low martian gravity snoring is,Reddit comment
no more! put differently: while zero gravity is annoying to us humans (things move too easily and don't stop moving and there's also that confusing lack of direction!) plus zero,Reddit comment
gravity is super unhealthy to human bones and eyesight in mars gravity which is about a third of earth gravity you'll not just be healthy but you'll also be a,Reddit comment
literal superhuman. by all likelihood mars will be a superior living experience to the average human. but beyond the sheer experience level that mars offers to the luxury cruise traveler,Reddit comment
there are a couple of practical 'business' advantages as well to living on mars should you decide to live work and do business on mars: time: you probably know the,Reddit comment
common complaint that unfortunately there are only 24 hours in a day. as it happens on mars there's an extra hour available every day! it can be used to catch,Reddit comment
up on sleep - or to do a bit more work. real estate: real estate on the surface of mars is still cheap (well except real estate in or around,Reddit comment
elon city) especially ever since the martian government started not just giving away new land use licenses but started paying people to settle new land and make it habitable. exporting,Reddit comment
rare resources to earth: mars is very rich in mineral resources for example if you find such huge gold meteorites nuggets lying on the surface of mars like this iron,Reddit comment
meteorite then it's very likely profitable to bring the gold back to earth: if a round-trip of a single person weighing ~100 kg costs only $500000 then it sure makes,Reddit comment
sense to bring back 100 kg of gold from the surface of mars worth around $3000000 back on earth. rhodium and platinum are similarly valuable as well. (just make sure,Reddit comment
you don't ship back too much of it to not collapse the terrestrial market price.) new science: for space geeks mars is where the science is not just in terms,Reddit comment
of researching the history of mars or that of the early solar system or having an easy repository of on surface meteorites to look at but it's also a natural,Reddit comment
'clean skies' environment where you could probably be doing astronomy all day around with no light pollution and further away from the sun. probes sent to the outer planets or,Reddit comment
to the asteroid belt could have a much faster turnaround lower launch costs and lower communication latencies than probes from the earth. not to mention exoplanet studies would probably be,Reddit comment
easier from the surface of mars than from the surface of earth. propellant production and shipping: with local manufacturing it would also be cheaper to launch mass into low earth,Reddit comment
orbit from mars than from earth so even sending plain bulk propellant to leo could potentially be cheaper from mars. (until the moon or near earth asteroids are settled.) it's,Reddit comment
definitely cheaper to send propellant from mars to high earth orbit than from the surface of earth. advanced space robotics industry: since for many years there is going to be,Reddit comment
a scarcity of human workers mars will be a natural industrial environment to utilize robots in. because the atmosphere of mars is very close to vacuum mars robots might be,Reddit comment
a natural fit for leo and in general space construction jobs as well. it would also be cheaper to launch them even to leo and much cheaper to launch them,Reddit comment
to luna or other high orbit targets. advanced spaceship manufacturing: mars is also (when there are no dust storms) a natural 'clean room' environment which could host a high value,Reddit comment
manufacturing base that could build things like spaceships: a very thin cold dry and non-oxidizing atmosphere is ideal to build sensitive machinery and to run sensitive industrial processes in. utilizing,Reddit comment

12 meter composite cryotank. i have some high level background knowledge of carbon fiber layup but am looking for some input from those with more experience. from what i understand,Reddit comment
it appears that each section of the tank likely consists of prepreg tape placed on the surface of a mold. these can then be cured using an autoclave or oven,Reddit comment
process. my questions are as follows. what are the possible mold configurations? can one mold consist of an entire cylinder (ends open) which will create the walls of the vessel,Reddit comment
as one piece? if this method is used could the mold be removed it were metallic or does a metallic mold require two half circle cylinders which then need to,Reddit comment
be joined? if so can a foam type mold be used to create this section in a single piece and drilled out - or is this an amateur technique only?,Reddit comment
it appears that photos of the tank have fasteners running along the hoop direction on each side of the tank equator. if each hemisphere is created as one or multiple,Reddit comment
pieces then joined to together how is this joining typically completed? if with fasteners how is this achieved/what additional parts are required to bring them together? can they simply force,Reddit comment
each half together then overwrap with additional tape longitudinally to join them (thereby avoiding fasteners)? any thoughts would be much appreciated. since i keep seeing this question asked in the,Reddit comment

sort of signalling shortcut for the spacex ground crew. i.e. they switch from blinking to solid to indicate some milestone in the safing of the landed stage. in the case,Reddit comment
of a failed landing spacex is required to remove any floating debris from the ocean surface (they'd want to anyways for any possible analysis). based on their filing for vandenberg,Reddit comment
rtls wherein they discuss contingency barge landings and the possibility of explosions on the asds they expect something like 25 pieces of floating debris. these are mainly from the legs,Reddit comment
the copvs and the lox drain line. finding any such floating debris at night would be much easier if it had a blinking light on it. i'd certainly like to,Reddit comment
hear if anyone has any other ideas on why the lights were there and whether previous flights had them. i looked at the video of the landed stage from the,Reddit comment

poised to announce the new contract to follow on from the original commercial resupply services contract so we've decided to make a sticky thread to stop the discussion fragmenting. background,Reddit comment
 commercial resupply services (crs) are contracts awarded by nasa for delivery of cargo and supplies to the international space station on commercially operated spacecraft. the initial round known as,Reddit comment
crs1 awarded $1.6 billion to spacex for 12 cargo runs using their dragon capsule and $1.9 billion to orbital sciences (now orbital atk) for 8 cargo runs using their cygnus,Reddit comment
spacecraft. now comes the second round (crs2) to follow on from the hugely successful first round. whoever wins the upcoming contract will resupply the iss in the 2017-2024 time-frame. candidates,Reddit comment
 five companies are known to have submitted proposals to nasa: spacex orbital atk boeing sierra nevada and lockheed martin. the old giants boeing and lockheed are already known (but,Reddit comment
unconfirmed) to have been eliminated from the competition leaving just: spacex dragon which launches on the falcon 9 can return cargo to earth can carry unpressurized cargo in the trunk,Reddit comment
and is likely to be the least expensive. major downside: is quite volume limited. orbital cygnus which launches on an atlas v/antares has very high pressurized volume (almost triple the,Reddit comment
internal volume of dragon) burns up in the atmosphere on return (useful for getting rid of trash). major downside: new version of the antares rocket has not yet flown. sierra,Reddit comment
nevada dreamchaser which launches on atlas v returns cargo lands horizontally using wings (high crossrange gentle landing environment). major downside: still needs further development and has not yet flown in,Reddit comment
space. it is expected that nasa will chose two out of three of these competitors. each competing vehicle has both upsides and downsides and it will be up to nasa,Reddit comment
to weigh the attributes of each against each other depending on what it decides will be most useful. monetary value  it is currently unknown what amount of money the,Reddit comment
winners will be awarded. each competitor will have proposed a figure in their bid and the relative sizes of these figures will undoubtedly play an important role in helping nasa,Reddit comment
make their decision. ha! hopefully that title got your attention. so... i was discussing the recent hypetweet of chris b's with a friend. don't remember it? here you go: tease:,Reddit comment
it may take weeks or even months to be announced but what i've just been shown is the most exciting thing ever. #spacex i think everyone here reasonably expects this,Reddit comment
to be related to spacex's mars plans probably concerning bfr/mct. still it's kind of vague don't you think? bergin later commented that on a scale of 1-10 of hype it,Reddit comment
"was a ""236"". 236. why 236? why pick a seemingly random number? i realize some people like to joke and give oddly specific numbers when asked generic questions but this",Reddit comment
doesn't seem like that. i don't think that number is just a joke. what performance indicators do we know could be in that numerical range? thrust is definitely out isp,Reddit comment
is (hopefully) out. let's switch topics. what do we know about falcon heavy? supposedly with the recent f9v1.2 upgrades it might be able to take 58-60t into leo in a,Reddit comment
totally expendable configuration with magiccrossfeedtm. seems kind of high but apparently spacex can defy the rocket equation so who am i to argue. roll back a few hours today and,Reddit comment
"we have this interesting quote from gwynne shotwell: ""mars rocket will have three or four times more thrust than falcon heavy."" big deal right? we already ruled out thrust. say",Reddit comment
for a second though that thrust is roughly analogous to payload to orbit... goddamn it echo drop the narrative and get to your point! what if 236 instead represents the,Reddit comment
number of tonnes spacex's mars rocket can take to leo? don't believe me? watch this half life 3-esque math: 236 payload to leo of hypothetical mars rocket / 4 upper,Reddit comment
limit for scaling factor between thrusts of fh and mars rocket = 59 right in the center of fh's predicted payload to orbit. cool huh? what are the chances of,Reddit comment
that being a coincidence? what i don't know is whether that value would hypothetically be expendable or reusable. it seems like it needs to be the reusable value if we,Reddit comment
follow a spacex-preferred approach of a single launch to get all the equipment up and then another to refuel. it also fits right down the line of being able to,Reddit comment
"land ""100t of useful payload"" on mars. now i totally agree that thrust does not scale linearly with payload. there's huge performance differences between both vehicles namely due to their",Reddit comment
different use of propellants and their inherent efficiencies - so i could very well be wrong here... ..but something feels right about this. i'd love some feedback on your thoughts/how,Reddit comment
crazy you think i am. this rocket is going to be amazing. spacex have announced they intend to launch their mars colonial transporter in 2022 which has effectively fired the,Reddit comment
starter pistol for bids from all the states who wish to host the custom built mct launch site. for spacex to meet this tight timeline to launch mct they should,Reddit comment
be deep in the selection process for possible sites. gaining the necessary construction and launch permits is an extended process which can’t commence until they decide on a suitable launch,Reddit comment
site spacex are currently constructing a falcon 9/falcon heavy launch site at boca chica beach texas which in theory could be extended for mct use (given the required permits). however,Reddit comment
it is not at all certain that this is their intent there are many other states who would love to become the first step to mars. recently spacex’s senior council,Reddit comment
schenewerk advised texas legislators that nasa offer a $20m infrastructure grant as an apparent prompt for the legislators to sharpen their pencils over boca chica. “we appreciate texas’ commitment to,Reddit comment
this industry and the recognition that it is a growing opportunity for this state. jobs high tech manufacturing stem education – we bring it all and we are very excited,Reddit comment
to make that contribution” schenewerk said. it could even be argued that spacex’s relatively slow pace of construction at bc (compared to pad 39a work at the cape – the,Reddit comment
hif appeared like a mushroom overnight) could be aimed at procuring the best possible subsidies and tax breaks from the state and local authority for the follow on mct work.,Reddit comment
cape canaveral would love to host mct launches and quite possibly georgia and puerto rico too. unfortunately more northerly states are probably out of the running because spacex would prefer,Reddit comment
to launch as close to the equator as possible to maximise the payload they deliver to low earth orbit (where they intend to refuel mct). puerto rico is certainly the,Reddit comment
dark horse in this race they are considerably closer to the equator (18 degrees latitude) and could provide an ideal location for both launches and landings (from the east and,Reddit comment
west) on the island of vieques naval base. georgia should also be highly motivated to receive this mct work after they lost out to texas in the competition to host,Reddit comment
spacex’s first private launch site. boca chica (26 degrees latitude) would appear the safe bet for mainland sites - if it wasn’t for their reticence in providing further financial support.,Reddit comment
recently we learned nasa and spacex have been in negotiations regarding mars missions since 2014. nasa must be licking their lips at the prospect of mct launches from the cape,Reddit comment
(28.5 degrees latitude). reportedly some people believe nasa was closed after they ceased launching space shuttle so they would love to show the world they are back at the centre,Reddit comment
of space exploration. the question of where mct should be launched presumably came up (either directly or indirectly) at these talks with nasa no doubt offering their $20m infrastructure grant,Reddit comment
as a platform for further negotiation. however it’s quite possible the matter of who will host mct has already been settled. last week elon musk met with the secretary of,Reddit comment
defence ash carter during which the topic of mct probably came up. an mct launch failure could have the equivalent destructive force of a tactical nuke hence this falls well,Reddit comment
within the sec-def’s purview. elon was certainly pumped about mct in his subsequent washington post interview:- “this is going to be mind blowing” he said. “mind blowing. it’s [mct] going,Reddit comment
to be really great. i’m so tempted to talk more about the details of it. but i have to restrain myself.” so something appears to have been agreed at least,Reddit comment

have been raised recently about how exactly spacex prices their products the performance of falcon 9 & falcon heavy and how these prices relate to the real world contracts that,Reddit comment
have been signed by spacex with satellite companies and the government. there's quite a few community members here (i'm talking to all those who joined post-musk-ama) who may not realize,Reddit comment
some of the intricacies involved and i think there's perhaps a few misconceptions to dispell overall. i've been a spacex fan for maybe 8 years now (watched f1f4 live!) but,Reddit comment
it's only been in the past 2-3 that i've had the maturity and knowledge to actually understand a bunch of accounting/physics/mathematics concepts to start performing a variety of analyses. now,Reddit comment
i don't claim to be an authoritative source here and finance/business is not my area of expertise; i'm just offering my interpretation of their pricing which i believe to be,Reddit comment
"the ""most correct"" - backed up with evidence i have accumulated over the years. i hope you all find it agreeable and i'm going to try and be as factual",Reddit comment
as possible. to start spacex's launch pricing & payload capacity claims that are available on their website are generally correct enough that you can perform crude back of the envelope,Reddit comment
"calculations with reasonable ""enthusiast-grade"" accuracy. listed in us dollars these online prices refer to launches booked for a 2016 flight so when spacex raises their prices they're also attempting to",Reddit comment
factor in inflation into their future lineup. onto the real meat. falcon 9  falcon 9 is currently advertised with a reusable payload capacity but an expendable price of $61.2m.,Reddit comment
how do we know this? payload: musk has stated that they reserve a significant percentage of their capacity for reusability. physical proof: spacex are also flying some large payloads that,Reddit comment
well exceed their stated capacity. amos-6 for example scheduled for a 2016 f9 flight is 5500kg. well exceeding spacex's claim of 4.85t to gto. if 4.85t were the true maximum,Reddit comment
this flight would be impossible. for further evidence we can corroborate against nasa's launch vehicle performance query website. enter in an inclination of 28.5 degrees with a 200km circular orbit,Reddit comment
(these are essentially the same baseline specifications spacex use to rate their vehicles) - falcon 9 shows a performance of 16625kg while spacex claims 13150kg. additionally if you enter an,Reddit comment
elliptical query with an apogee at geo altitude the response for falcon 9 is 5755kg - which fits nicely with amos-6's mass. for the falcon 9 pricing: commercial flights match,Reddit comment
"spacex's quoted prices very closely eutelsat and abs paid ""approximately $30m each"" for their dual flight last month. however there is significant give: ses-8 paid ""well under us$60 million"" for",Reddit comment
their flight which is only fair considering it was spacex's first gto flight. orbcomm paid $42.6 million for 2 flights! government-launched flights are more murky. spacex has stated an air,Reddit comment
force launch will cost approximately $90m. this matches well with tess which nasa is paying $87m to launch. the cost to launch dscovr is completely unclear. initial reusability pricing has,Reddit comment
already been decided upon. i'm not willing to share but it's a significant drop and it's also nowhere close to the bs $200k-$10m values that have been thrown around at,Reddit comment
times - if this surprises you you need to do more reading on the complexities of rocketry. yes there are various additional optional extras that spacex offer for payloads examples,Reddit comment
of which are demonstrated in this comment. these can add/subtract from the real cost probably by +-$10m but $61.2m is a good ballpark figure for commercial flights. however the advertized,Reddit comment
"performance of falcon 9 or falcon heavy will not change despite the introduction of ""f9v1.2"". while there will be real performance gains that will be realized with 1.2 these values",Reddit comment
do not improve on paper. why? the f9 baseline specification (and fh) that spacex shows on their website shares with their customers and provides to nasa is not able to,Reddit comment
be met with f9v1.1 - it's underpowered. the numbers online are for a paper specification of falcon that spacex created when it was developing f9 & fh. this has been,Reddit comment
demonstrated with all prior gto missions to date - recovery has not been attempted. musk stated the tank stretch and engine uprating would allow spacex to achieve reusability on even,Reddit comment
"gto flights which seems to dovetail with the ""4.85t to gto"" claim. regardless i would still expect flights that exceed this mass to be expended. what was spacex's rationale in",Reddit comment
doing this? f9 was always their immediate launcher - they've always wanted reusability built in so they just decided from the start that the numbers they'd show would be for,Reddit comment
reusability. but because reusability wasn't instantly achievable they had to offer the expendable pricing for f9 alongside it. falcon heavy  this is the source of much controversy. but i'll,Reddit comment
do my best to explain what i see as the correct view. falcon heavy is currently advertised with an expendable payload capacity but a fully reusable and (now hidden) partially,Reddit comment
reusable/expendable price. this is likely done to tout fh's monster lifting capability. payload capacity explained: in a fully expendable configuration with crossfeed enabled fh can deliver 53000kg to a 200km,Reddit comment
"28.5deg inclined leo. however as we all know crossfeed has been put in the ""probably not going to happen"" basket alongside second stage reusability. thankfully spacex state directly that the",Reddit comment
maximum payload to the same leo without cf - 45000kg. this is the correct capacity. however sadly these numbers aren't scaled across to the gto and martian capacities which should,Reddit comment
be ~18350kg (not 21200kg) and ~11400kg (not 13200kg) furthermore i imagine that there's some slight fudging done with these numbers similar how the real world tesla model s range is,Reddit comment
always a smidgen less than stated so be aware. reusability of the cores especially the central core drops the payload drastically. musk has in the past stated all three boosters,Reddit comment
reused would equal about 7t of capacity. keep this number in mind. a lot of the questions i've seen is how can spacex offer 3x the number of cores for,Reddit comment
less than 50% additional cost. i'll try and explain that too. pricing explained: spacex used to publish 2 prices for fh. $85m for 6.4t to gto and $135m for what,Reddit comment
was essentially unlimited capacity. today the latter price has been hidden (but is crucially still in effect and can be seen by using the wayback machine) and the former is,Reddit comment
"now $90m. no big deal $5m isn't that much and $90m is bloody cheap for such a rocket anyway. the ""$90m for 6.4t"" plan includes full reusability it's totally cost",Reddit comment
"ineffective for the cores to be expendable. more crucially this number matches nearly perfectly for what musk once stated: ""three boosters reused = 7t"". in this case spacex have decided",Reddit comment
that 6.4t to gto is the maximum that fh can take in a fully reusable mode. it also matches quite nicely with the initial reusability price offerings internally. this gets,Reddit comment
bumped up to $150m (courtesy gwynne shotwell at the hearing) for the u.s. government. but then again government is gunna' government - that isn't spacex's fault. bear in mind -,Reddit comment
this is $150m for 6.4t to gto capacity with full reusability not $150m for an expendable rocket. the wildcard is the now hidden $135m price that spacex marketed at one,Reddit comment
"point for an ""unlocked"" falcon heavy. i can only assume it's probably more like $140m now (and probably $200m-250m for the government) but it likely either includes partial reusability of",Reddit comment
the boosters only or is a fully expendable value and is the only price point where the full capacity of fh is unlocked. what was spacex's rationale in doing this?,Reddit comment
falcon heavy was designed to be a heavy lifter. they wanted to emphasize that so the published capacities are in an expendable configuration. but fh simply wasn't going to be,Reddit comment
ready for a number of years so they put a bet that by the time reusability is ready fh would just be starting to fly - and it would fly,Reddit comment
with at least partial reusability from the start so that's how they matched their pricing. that seems to be what is happening. what is the immediate effect of this for,Reddit comment
us? any calculated $/kg values for fh are completely false and don't make any sense. the key thing to realize is that spacex's published payload capacities are paper specifications predicated,Reddit comment
off of a baseline - no single rocket matches it. f9v1.1 came close but wasn't powerful enough. f9v1.2 is spacex's latest attempt to reconcile the different in actual rocket performance,Reddit comment
and the paper specification. i hope you've enjoyed this post and that spacex's pricing and payloads are a bit clearer for a few people now. let me know your thoughts,Reddit comment
and whether you agree or disagree. i'm fairly sure this is the for what it's worth you all should know that when you see any comment written by me that,Reddit comment
discusses pricing or payload capacity this is essentially the set of rules from which i operate and make my assumptions. i'd be happy to respond to any suggestions or questions,Reddit comment
too. :) so in the midst of the party i hope to not be the party pooper to ask the question nobody is asking: why should a bfr be built,Reddit comment
at all? if history teaches us anything it is that past big projects that failed often brought down or almost brought down their parent companies. can you imagine the consequences,Reddit comment
of a bfr failure? its engineering and construction will likely run into the close billions at least the consequences of its explosion will be critical to say the least -,Reddit comment
"it is not a rocket that a company can just ""build again"" and i have my doubts that it will land successfully on the first try. the reason i say",Reddit comment
this is because i do not understand what is wrong with using the by-then perfected falcon 9 and falcon 9 heavy's reusability feature to perform 100+ flights to fully assemble,Reddit comment
a modular mct in-orbit and then fly its passengers to it in batches of 5-10 people the way it is done today for the iss. the mct could serve as,Reddit comment
a living area operating exclusively in space while the modified capsules in which the people will be sent to it can serve as earth/mars landers. therefore an mct architecture will,Reddit comment
comprise of a large structure much bigger than the iss assembled in orbit over a multitude of flights to which 10+ capsules will be attached in which passengers are delivered,Reddit comment
to and from it. these 10+ capsules will then perform marsian landings and takeoffs as much as necessary to deliver both people and supplies. it just seems to me that,Reddit comment
a 1 bfr 1 mct architecture is like putting all eggs into one basket and it has to work from the very first try. even if the first mission is,Reddit comment
autonomous (without passengers) it's failure could also mean the end of spacex's dreams of marsian colonization as the financial consequence could be devastating. and if it's a failure with 100+,Reddit comment

benefits over launching many smaller rockets. for massive colonization i underestimated how much of a stress and risk launching thousands of rockets would pose in order to assemble in-orbit mcts,Reddit comment

however it didn't really bother me because i figured thats why they're hiring me. they had a cleanroom which i had a lot of experience in from medical devices. from,Reddit comment
my experience i was able to point out some low hanging fruit that could improve their production floors. after tour i had my presentation up on their computer and waited,Reddit comment

this is fairly easy to do on a project that you spend a few months on. afterwards they ushered me into a pretty small conference room where i sat and,Reddit comment

"describe the interview difficulty as ""medium"". nobody asked me any theoretical or textbook questions. also no philosophical questions about my thoughts on space or spaceflight. all questions were strictly business",Reddit comment
and directed towards work experience and projects. i think this is pretty easy when you spend 8 months working on a project alone you know all the ins and outs,Reddit comment
of it so there's not really anything anyone can drill you on. overall interviews went great and gelled well with interviewers. they brought up numerous times the working hours and,Reddit comment
environment and asked if i was worried about it. i told them i worked at a startup before so i'm used to it and not scared of it. the only,Reddit comment
odd questions i got was one interviewer asked me: 1) how many launches spacex had done 2) what was the name of the rockets 3) how many rockets there are,Reddit comment
in a falcon assembly. i didn't really know 1) and 2) but i did my best. he was an exception not the rule. overall the interview went from 10:30am-4:00pm. it,Reddit comment
went well. a week later the recruiter called and said that the interviewers said great things. the direct manager was unable to meet with me when i went in and,Reddit comment
he wanted to do a final phone interview just to get to know me before hiring me. at that point i knew spacex was going to give an offer but,Reddit comment
decided for a variety of reasons that i'd rather take the other job offer i had on the table. if anyone is interested i can discuss this more. let me,Reddit comment
know if you have any questions about any other step in this process. now that spacex is gearing up for a busy 2017 i am curious to the subs’ thoughts,Reddit comment
on how spacex their customers and the various regulatory agencies will view ruds in the near-term and (mostly) long-term. new space is very enthusiastic about increasing cadence significantly: spacex has,Reddit comment
their eyes on the leo satellite network and massive colony fleets to mars not to mention their significant commercial backlog; blue origin plans to enable a massive orbital infrastructure and,Reddit comment
economy; even ula is looking to join the fun as well with their proposed cis-lunar plans. putting these plans into effect requires innovation and innovation in rocketry usually means ruds,Reddit comment
like it or not. it may seem like spacex is prone to accidents but in the scheme of things its record is rather remarkable for a new rocket company. with,Reddit comment
increased cadence comes increased odds of launch failures. 1:200 failure modes may not make an appearance in a rocket family that only gets ~100 launches before retiring (i always cringe,Reddit comment
when tory bruno tweets the number of successful ula launches stop tempting fate!). supporting an orbital economy and moon/mars colonies will likely require many hundreds of launches per year in,Reddit comment
the future. how will regulatory agencies and customers handle ruds on reusable rockets? will a f9 rud on the 7th re-flight of a 1st stage ground all f9 for months,Reddit comment
regardless of flight history? if an its launch fails at the beginning of a mars transfer window is that that and the whole fleet is grounded for 6 months while,Reddit comment
the faa reviews the anomaly? are we about to undergo a new “1950s” age of rocketry where failure rates rise but a significant amount of knowledge is gained? can new,Reddit comment
space weather this learning curve successfully while keeping customers happy? are there lessons to be learned from the aviation industry? these are the questions that always pop into my head,Reddit comment
when i read about future space plans. customers want their payloads reliably delivered regulatory agencies are slow and bureaucratic by nature and new space needs significant innovation (and risk) to,Reddit comment
achieve their goals. something has to change in this relationship for new space to succeed in our lifetimes. i’d love to hear the subs’ thoughts on these issues. falcon 9's,Reddit comment
automated launch aborts from recently remind us all that despite major progress launching orbital rockets is still basically an all-or-nothing proposition - something that will continue to make it uniquely,Reddit comment
difficult even when (knock on wood) full and rapid reusability is achieved. certain steps help hedge a little bit on the zero-sum nature of launch - e.g. hold-downs after ignition,Reddit comment
"and engine-out survivability - but the process of launch after liftoff is still so ""brittle"" that the line between success and failure is excruciatingly narrow. reusability will reduce the probability",Reddit comment
of failure and the financial burden when it occurs but will not make it any less total in the event of an in-flight rud. for spacex's long-term plans this is,Reddit comment
something that must eventually be addressed for both economic and safety reasons. an aircraft that experiences catastrophic technical failure on takeoff can turn around and land and indeed that (fortunately),Reddit comment
happens a lot more often than fatal crashes. but once liftoff occurs an orbital rocket is committed: it must either find a way to limp to orbit despite whatever failures,Reddit comment
"have occurred or else sacrifice itself for the sake of ground safety (notwithstanding eventual les for cargo and/or crew). given that f9 first stages can already handle hard landings (""hover-slams"")",Reddit comment
with minimal fuel once the upper stage and payload are separated this would seem like at least a rudimentary basis for beginning to think about recoverable fts. because make no,Reddit comment
mistake once in the cost domain of something like bfr/its that's intended to fly dozens or even hundreds of times having totally unrecoverable domains of flight is probably not economically,Reddit comment
sustainable. first allow me to ask a naive question about an extreme case since so much progress begins that way: what would it take to land the entire stack intact,Reddit comment
back at the pad after some brief period of flight? obviously the complete f9 stack is not designed to handle being landed so quite a bit would need to change,Reddit comment
- it's very long and narrow the interstage probably can't handle torques the legs on the first stage aren't wide or strong enough etc. etc. but the differences are not,Reddit comment
all negative: only minimal thermal protection would be needed after a brief period in flight and you have all the fuel you could need while having the option of dumping,Reddit comment
any that's not worth carrying. it's not actually a crazy idea compared to the changes spacex has already made to the status quo of the launch industry is it? at,Reddit comment
least for future reference in terms of how vehicles can evolve. but having gone to the extreme let's examine the more cautious question of stage-separate recoverable fts. that would have,Reddit comment
some predictable events involved: emergency meco. suppose failures occur that guarantee the stack cannot make it to orbit but it retains enough function that the first stage could rtls or,Reddit comment
hop to the drone ship. given that the recoverable stages land with just 1 or 3 engines while orbital capability only survives with at least 8 engines this does not,Reddit comment
seem far-fetched. the orbit-canceling failure having been detected the rocket automatically shuts off exactly as it would if still in hold-down mode after ignition. dump the 2nd stage propellants and,Reddit comment
whatever amount of booster propellant might be a problem given the nature of the failure. bleeds off momentum increases the safety of the stack and allows drag to slow it,Reddit comment
down more quickly. if the speed is already low enough at this point you could have emergency stage separation; if the speed has gotten too high to safely separate while,Reddit comment
still in atmosphere perhaps after venting the 2nd stage the stack is tilted just a little bit relative to velocity to increase drag manageably and reduce speed to where separation,Reddit comment
can occur. stage separation & payload escape. the two stages separate at some angle that takes them away from each other while protecting their integrity then whatever les protects the,Reddit comment
payload or crew spacecraft activates. the second stage is still sacrificed since we're looking at this through the lens of the current architecture but hypothetically future recovery systems could be,Reddit comment
incorporated there too. maybe payload fairings could themselves be a part of an emergency cargo recovery system. booster relights and flies back experiencing far less extreme temperatures and stresses than,Reddit comment
"it would have anyway. so we can see there's a spectrum of hypothetical possibilities for recoverable flight-termination. from the ""crazy"" notion of full-stack recovery from in-flight abort down to ""mere""",Reddit comment
payload and booster recovery. i make no claims about the feasibility of any specific part of this analysis but something along this spectrum will be necessary for an economical sustainable,Reddit comment
mars flight architecture and certainly wouldn't hurt along intermediate steps. transportation is simply incompatible with zero-sum outcomes. the pursuit of reusability is just the most immediate acknowledgment of that fact.,Reddit comment
with the re-flight of the new shepard spacecraft this seems like an appropriate moment to discuss what the future may hold for both companies with regards to the cost of,Reddit comment
"launches both for falcon 9 and for the future blue origin single engined ""very big brother"" (vbb). remember the usual caveats with blue origin apply here - we know very",Reddit comment
little about their plans! on the face of the issue both companies appear to be following a very similar re-use strategy: first stage is re-used using a vertical landing. second,Reddit comment
stage is expendable - neither spacex or blue are currently considering second stage re-use (sad face). however there appear to be some minor differences: spacex uses 9 first stage engines,Reddit comment
making the job of landing easier. blue origin wants to only use a single first stage engine - implying not only very deep throttling but perhaps settling on a lower,Reddit comment
twr first stage than ideal and possibly general performance. [citation needed] blue origin is initially going to build a much smaller rocket in the ~2017-2019 timeframe which would only be,Reddit comment
able to compete with spacex for smaller launches. blue origin probably isn't considering an asds-style landing although they did attempt to file a patent for it with the performance hit,Reddit comment
that rtls will bring. so far we have heard of no further developments - but why would we? and some pretty major ones: blue origin is focusing solely on a,Reddit comment
methalox first stage for their orbital vehicles with all the advantages that brings. blue origin is planning on using a hydrolox second stage with all the advantages and disadvantages that,Reddit comment
brings. spacex wants to use a single fuel for the entire rocket with all the advantages and disadvantages that brings. spacex currently (and apparently intends to continue) manufacturing falcon stages,Reddit comment
off-site and then trucking them across the usa to the launch site. blue origin plans to manufacture them at the cape. this means they are not diameter-restricted as spacex are,Reddit comment
but they then cannot have the diversity of launch sites spacex has. the blue origin rocket appears to be two diameters although where the interstage second stage and payload fairing,Reddit comment
all start and stop is unclear. which leaves the question of who's will be the cheapest launcher. for the purposes of this we shall assume pretty similar reliabilities as we,Reddit comment
currently have no reason to believe otherwise! in my mind the overriding factor is the second stage as it is expendable in both designs and the obvious place to offload,Reddit comment
the now-in-excess first stage production capability. a spacex upper stage uses very similar tooling to the first stage so when first stage production winds down the cost per unit will,Reddit comment
stay very similar. however this means a less efficient rocket although what effect this has on cost is unclear. a blue origin upper stage is apparently going to be based,Reddit comment
on the new shepard spacecraft. ignoring (wisely??) the development costs this will mean a more expensive cost per unit as hydrolox engines tend to be much more expensive than keralox,Reddit comment
or [citation needed] methalox upper stages. because there can be very little common tooling between new shepard vbb first stage and vbb second stage as the diameters and materials will,Reddit comment
probably be different (although the second stage and new shepard will share engines) how much more expensive might they be? or might they have a method for bringing down the,Reddit comment
